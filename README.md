### Building program

304pacman is an EPITECH B-MAT-500 project.

It relies on path finding. The goal is to find the quickest path to the phantom.

You can see the differents options using the ``-h`` or ``--help`` options:

```term
$> ./304pacman --help
USAGE
        ./304pacman file c1 c2
DESCRIPTION
        file    file describing the board, using the following characters:
                        '0' for an empty square
                        '1' for a wall
                        'F' for the ghost's position
                        'P' for Pacman's position
        c1      character to display for a wall
        c2      character to display for an empty space
```

### Coding Style

304pacman is developed with Python. EPITECH doesn't impose any Coding Style to this but I tried to be as cleaner as possible.
